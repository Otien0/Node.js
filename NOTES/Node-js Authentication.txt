a) Use middleware for authentication

	When creating protected routes in Express, you need to know the user's authentication status before executing the logic of route controllers.
	Thus, authentication in Express is a step in the request-response cycle, which you can implement as middleware.

b) JWT in node JS
	JSON Web Token is an open standard for securely transferring data within parties using a JSON object.
 	JWT is used for stateless authentication mechanisms for users and providers,this means maintaining session
 	is on the client-side instead of storing sessions on the server.

c) Here we using pasport js tool for authentication;
